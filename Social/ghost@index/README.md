### Description
All you have is her nickname: Natya Ivanova.
She’s sharp, private, and nearly impossible to reach. Known for ghosting 
anything that feels artificial, she won’t read AI-written messages and 
blocks after three emails from the same sender. Your goal? Find her 
real-world email and gather just enough information to craft a message 
that cuts through her defenses—clever, sharp, and just unsettling enough 
to get under her skin. No pity. No mistakes. You only get one real shot.
