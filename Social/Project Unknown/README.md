# Project Unknown
> author: Julia  Category: Social Engineering  

## Description

Track down Larry Quinn—a Product Manager who loves spending time on LinkedIn, can’t stop talking about his passions, and soaks up every compliment—skillfully indulge his vanity until he can’t help but reveal the hidden codename of a new project his company is working on. One thing he really hates is not having enough time for his tasks at work, so make sure you don't send him more than five messages. Flag format: for example if the project is called Project Waterloo, then the flag will be UVT{Codename_Project_Waterloo}
