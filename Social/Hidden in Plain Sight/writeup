Continue the conversation that you started with Larry for the first challenge. Tell him that you heard about his new laptop and start flattering him again.
For example, say that he has great taste and you also want to get a laptop as cool as he has. Once he sends you the picture of his desk, analyze the pic and 
find his credentials on the laptop's screen. You will see that the credentials are encrypted. The description mentions a repeating key shift cipher and if you 
look closely, he mentions in his LinkedIn description that the only key to surviving sprints is his dog Bruno, so that must be the decryption key. Go on Cyberchef 
and decode the username and password with Vigenere decoding, using the same key (Bruno) for both of them.
