# Hidden in Plain Sight

## Description

Remember our friend Larry? Word on the street is he just upgraded to a new laptop—and he can’t resist showing it off. Engage him on LinkedIn and he’ll send you a photo of his desk (don't forget he's a busy person, so he won't respond to more than 5 messages). Tucked away in the clutter of notes and cables, lie his credentials which you need to breach the internal dashboard and dig deeper into their project. His notes may look like gibberish, but insiders whisper that he'll only encrypt them using a repeating key shift cipher.

Flag format: for example if the decrypted user is admin123, and the decrypted password is Larry1357!, then the flag will be UVT{user_admin123_password_Larry1357!}
