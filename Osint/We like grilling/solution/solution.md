The players have to find the Instagram page @smecheromanii (this is the only guessy part about this challenge as by searching smecheromanii on google no result is shown). There, the only post about grilling is the last post. Which places the player in county Mehedinti.

## Hint (maybe if no team solves it)

One of them accidentally revealed their location.

The next step would be to inspect the Instagram pages of the people tagged in the post, those being @iulia_gheju, @vld.isto and @lil.supi. 
By searching on the first two mentioned we find no other lead to Mehedinti County.

On @lil.supi 's instagram we can find this post from 2023 from what seems like the same place. He placed the location of the post as Eselnita, Orsova, Romania which is in Mehedinti County.

And the third picture in the post is this one:

We can think that this is the name of the place and if we search "bana Plapumio" on google we can find this:

So the location is Cabana Plapumioara in Eselnita, Mehedinti.

We can google search them and we find 2 locations, one that is "Permanently closed" and the other one.

We can scroll through the pictures on google maps to confirm that it is indeed the one in the instagram posts. 
The swimming pool:

The grill:

Right clicking in the google maps web app we find those coordinates:

And by using any online tool to generate the SHA256 we can get the flag according to the given format.
