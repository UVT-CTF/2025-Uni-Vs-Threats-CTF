### Description
A mysterious informant was last seen at a secret meeting point, a café 
tucked away on an unknown street. His message? Lost. His whereabouts? 
Unknown. All that remains is a single photograph—the last trace of his 
presence.
Your mission is to track him down. The city whispers secrets, but only 
those who know where to look will uncover them. Find the exact street 
where this café is located.
But hidden within this café lies a final clue, waiting to be uncovered. 
Before he vanished, the informant left behind a coded message hidden in 
plain sight—disguised as the total cost of an espresso, a "briochette sucre", an 
"éclair café", and a "fraisier". Find the price.
Time is ticking, detective. Will you uncover the informant’s fate, or will 
his secrets be lost forever?
