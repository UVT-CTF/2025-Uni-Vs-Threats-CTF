###### DESCRIPTION

My friend thinks he is a hacker. He is so annoying...

He always talks about shifting and you can always be sure to expect a 37 after he mentions a 13.

I need to find a new friend, not one from a reverse engineering class. He even dropped a stick with this file inside.

## Hint (given after 2 hours as the part with 37 was a bit too guessy)

  I remember that my friend told me last week: "If you're ever stuck remember to move 37 steps to the left".
