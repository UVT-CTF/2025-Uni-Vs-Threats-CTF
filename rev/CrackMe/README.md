### Description
After the sudden disappearance of Evil Inc.'s CEO, a mysterious digital safe surfaced on the black market. No one's sure what's inside, only that it requires a password to unlock. The interface is minimal, almost alien. And the efforts of those who've tried brute forcing? All in vain. 

Your task is straightforward: get in, find the code, and unlock whatever secrets the world wasn't meant to see.
