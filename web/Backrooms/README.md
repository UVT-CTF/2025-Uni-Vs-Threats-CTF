# Backrooms
> author: abcjr, category: web

### Description
You find yourself in an endless maze of forgotten tabs, flickering lights, and scripted puppets bound to loops they canâ€™t escape. They walk. They click. They reload. Over and over again.

In this realm, user agents are gods, and every gesture is watched.

To dig deeper, you must speak not like a user, but like the machine.

Strip away the interface. Learn their language. Speak their truth.
The door is there... if you know how to ask.

*"Open, sesame."*

**Running the docker container locally:**
```bash
docker rm -f backrooms
docker build -t backrooms .
docker run --name=backrooms --rm -p8080:8080 -it backrooms
```
