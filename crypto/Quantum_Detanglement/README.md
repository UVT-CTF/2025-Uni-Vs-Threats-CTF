# Quantum Detanglement
> author: taniusca, category: crypto

### Description
Alice built her own quantum computer, with some misterious functionalities.
It's been proven to have 0 noise. She can even see the qubits' states while they are entangled, without changing their quantic state! Don't ask how, not even we understand the physics behind it quite yet.
Luckily for Bob, it seems that she is fond of standard Bell states and superdense coding. 
Can you help him figure it out?
