# Solution

For the solution I just modified the source code from [randcrack](https://github.com/tna0y/Python-random-module-cracker) (because I'm lazy) since the algorithm from this challenge is based on Mersenne Twister.

I recommend reading [this](https://blog.ollien.com/posts/reverse-mersenne-twister/) before reading the solution if you are unfamiliar with how Mersenne Twister works.

For another solution please check bak's write-up in the Discord Channel.
