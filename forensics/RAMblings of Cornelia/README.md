# RAMblings Of Cornelia
> author: anca, category: forensics
### Description
Our digital forensics team, Shell Access Without Authorization (SAWAT), requires your help.  
One of our top analysts, Cornelia Kernelescu, had a bit of a... meltdown.  She’s vanished without a trace, but not before trashing her machine in what appears to be a very dramatic protest.

We believe Cornelia left behind an encrypted file containing sensitive internal data — likely SAWAT intel — along with some personal notes.  Think you can recover Cornelia’s digital trail?
