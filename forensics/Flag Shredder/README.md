### Description
Our top operative was moments away from exfiltrating a critical piece of intel when their USB drive was hastily wiped. All that remains is this disk image: freeflags.img.

On it, you'll find a suspicious executable that seems to be doing... something.

See if you can solve the case, we are counting on you!
