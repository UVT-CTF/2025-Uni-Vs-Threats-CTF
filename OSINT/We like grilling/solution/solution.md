The players have to find the Instagram page @smecheromanii (this is the only guessy part about this challenge as by searching smecheromanii on google no result is shown). There, the only post about grilling is the last post. Which places the player in county Mehedinti.

## Hint (maybe if no team solves it)

One of them accidentally revealed their location.

The next step would be to inspect the Instagram pages of the people tagged in the post, those being @iulia_gheju, @vld.isto and @lil.supi. 
By searching on the first two mentioned we find no other lead to Mehedinti County.
On @lil.supi 's instagram we can find this post from Eselnita, Orsova, Romania, which is in Mehedinty County.

And the third picture in the post is this one:

And if we search "bana Plapumio" on google we can find this:

So the location is Cabana Plapumioara in Eselnita, Mehedinti.

We can google search them and we find 2 locations, one that is "Permanently closed" and the other one.
Scrolling through the pictures we find on google maps we can confirm that it is indeed the location in the posts: the pool and the grill.
